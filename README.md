# Ulam-s-Spiral-Primes-and-Anti-primes
# This program generates the amazing Ulam's Prime spiral (Spiral of all â„• restricted to the primes). Notice the neat diagonals made by the primes? Can you spot the one with the greatest prime density?
# Drive link to a large-scale output of the program (for primes): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bLzgobRo1_DVbI3OT0_VAPwpJTG7wxwm?usp=sharing
# Also, using the anti_prime function, see what happens when the spiral is restricted to anti-primes (highly composite numbers) instead of primes.
